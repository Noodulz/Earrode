# Earrode

Earode is a React mobile app that quizzes you on the keys of various scales and chords in order to develop ear training and memorization. Initially
I'd wanted to create a simplified quiz app that could test me on identifying what key are certain sounds in, especially after trying out many
other apps that didn't quite work or were too fleshed out. This project is a culmination of my goals of hoping to be better at identifying what key
are songs and scales in in order to then better my skills in piano and guitar. 

The app can be demoed [here](https://snack.expo.dev/6YOTphjU1), question bank in development
